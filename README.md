**Identification and Discrete-Time Control of A Heating System**

Discrete-time PID controller by using Desired Model Method (Inverse Dynamics Method) for control behavior.

Control experiment simulated using Matlab + Simulink


From measured data graph, it has been assumed that the heater behavior could be described with second order deferential equation. Represented in the S-plane.
